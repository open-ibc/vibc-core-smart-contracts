# spec for deploying contracts
# {{name}} is replaced with one of the following, whichever matches first
# - the deployed contract address whose name matches `name` (not factoryName)
# - variables of the running chain, e.g. {{chain.chainName}}, {{chain.chainId}}
# - deployment factory names from written deployment files
# NOTE: order of the contracts matters, as some contracts depend on others
# contracts with no deps should be placed before those with deps

## The following arguments can be specified in contracts spec:
# name: name of key that will be stored in the contract registry
# deployer: must be # name of key that will be stored in the contract registry a valid name in accountRegistry; default to 'default' if not specified
# description: description to be stored in the contract registry
# factoryName: the name of the typechain factory used to deploy the contract
# deployer: deployer key, should correspond to either a private key or one that can be looked up in the evm.accounts.yaml
# libraries: if a contract depends on libraries, the location of the library file & the deployed library address can be specified here, as an array with 2 elements
# deployArgs: The arguments that will be called in the contract constructor. Note: if $INITARGS is passed in as an argument, it will be abi.encode the arguments passed to the init paramater
# init: any arguments that need to be abi encoded (e.g. for calling upgradeToAndCall for ERC1967Proxy). These will be rendered in the place of $INITARGS
