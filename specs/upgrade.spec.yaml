# This file contains a sample spec for sending Txs to contracts. 
# This spec can be used for sending any tx to a contract, including proxy upgrades, calling setters, transferring ownership, etc.
# similar to in contract specs, {{name}} is replaced with one of the following, whichever matches first
# - the deployed contract address whose name matches `name` (not factoryName)
# - variables of the running chain, e.g. {{chain.chainName}}, {{chain.chainId}}
# - deployment factory names from written deployment files 
# NOTE: order of the txs matters, as some txs might depend on others
# deployer: must be a valid name in accountRegistry; default to 'default' if not specified

## The following arguments can be specified in tx spec: 
# name: name of entry that will be stored in tx registry
# description: description in tx registry
# factoryName: factory to use to read abi to send tx
# deployer: can be set in the accounts.yaml 
# address: address of contract to call method on 
# signature: signature of method to call for this tx
# args: args to make the function call with, need to be compatible with the signature
